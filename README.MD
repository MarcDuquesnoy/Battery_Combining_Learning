Battery_Combining_Learning
========================================================

Battery_Combining_Learning is a repository with all necessary
informations and ressources for experimental & stochastique analysis.

Please, do not hesitate to discover the team of researchers behind the librairy and also the ARTISTIC project
 involved : [ARTISTIC](https://www.u-picardie.fr/erc-artistic/?L=0)


Setup
========================================================
We ask you to get a virtual environment such as **conda** for the Python exploration.
Go to their webpage and download it. All dependencies will be
installed on your environment.

Please, note you can modify paths of datasets on your own when you launch codes.

Ressources
========================================================

This repository contains two sub-folders :
1. Data Driven : SISSO approach for the predictions of tortuosities and
pourcentages of contacts.
2. Experimental : Polynomial fitting within experimental data for the 
prediction of the porosity after calendering.
